Notes
=====

Images
------
* Target resolution for full size images: 4k UHD (3840 × 2160). Compression level: 10 (low-high).
  * This doubles the current most common HD resolution (1920 × 1080) while keeping the same aspect ratio, thus striking a balance between efficiency and futureproofing.
* Target resolution for thumbnails: 768 × 432. Compression level 7 (high-medium).
  * 20% of 4k UHD. Going to try to scale images by rems instead of pixels. This may change.
