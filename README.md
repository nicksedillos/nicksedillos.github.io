Web developer portfolio, made for the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp, September 2018.

* GitHub repository: https://github.com/nicksedillos/nicksedillos.github.io
* Deployment: https://nicksedillos.github.io/

## Project requirements

> Your updated site should have the following content:
>
> * Your name
> * Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address
> * List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:
>	* Project title
>	* Link to the deployed version
>	* Link to the code on GitHub
>
> The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:
>
> * Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
> * Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
>
> To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements to ensure your portfolio site will help you be employer competitive.
>
> * At least 3 deployed projects
> * External content:
>	* Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far
>	* Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem, how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach
>	* Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable
> Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look "polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
>
> * Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.
> * Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
> * Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects

## My approach

This site was constructed with simple HTML and a CSS reset. I also studied the Markdown documentation to format the README.
