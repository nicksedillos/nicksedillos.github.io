## Project requirements

>Your updated site should have the following content:
>
>* Your name
>* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address
>* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:
>	* Project title
>	* Link to the deployed version
>	* Link to the code on GitHub
>
>The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:
>
>* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
>* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
