<p>The other day I was idly searching for newspaper headlines from the day I was born, and I came across the June 21, 1982 edition of the Monmouth County, NJ <em>Daily Register</em>.</p>
<p>By far the most famous event to occur that day was the birth of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and currently the baldingest member of the British royal family. I knew that. What I did not know was that Prince Charles postponed a polo match and took a helicopter back from France for the birth. Was it really worth it? Who can say?</p>
<p>There were three different stories about regional beauty pageants, plus one about the Miss America song. I know you're asking, is bodybuilding really a type of beauty pageant? In my opinion there is nothing more beautiful than a person who can crush your body into a discus and throw you into the sun.</p>
<p>On the Advice page, Emily Wilkens reminds ladies to keep their knees together while wearing miniskirts, and Ann Landers implores a “plump wife” to wear a girdle. Dr. Joyce Brothers explains the folly of telling your neighbor that her husband is cheating on her.</p>

<p>It’s the summer of 1982. You have $650 from your job stocking cigarette vending machines. Do you buy the 1972 Ford Maverick or the Quasar VHS video machine? Choose carefully. Your decision will determine whether this is a great summer or <em>the greatest summer ever</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, let's observe a moment of mindful gratitude for this:</p>
