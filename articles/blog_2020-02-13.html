<h1>2020-02-13: <em>The Little Mermaid</em></h1>
<p>Been listening to the <em>Little Mermaid</em> soundtrack, and the song “Part of Your World” makes me think Ariel would have become an alchemist/inventor/polymath after she turned human. Kind of like Lisa Tepes from Netflix’s <em>Castlevania</em>. Also since she talks to animals she probably would’ve been a vegetarian.</p>
