<h2><em>Everything's Coming Up Profits: The Golden Age of Industrial Musicals—1950s/1960s/1970s</em> (2013)</h2>
<p>Watched the documentary <em>Bathtubs over Broadway</em> on Netflix last month, about a comedy writer who discovered a forgotten genre of lavishly produced stage musicals commissioned for corporate internal sales meetings. Very much my shit. He's also written a book about the subject, and this is the three-volume musical companion to that book. <em>Mad Men</em> meets <em>Sonny and Cher</em>.</p>
<h2>Tony Banks—<em>Bankstatement</em>/<em>Still</em>/<em>Strictly Inc.</em>/<em>A Chord Too Far</em> (1989–2015)</h2>
<p>Selections from the recently remastered discography of the keyboardist of Genesis. Proggy adult contemporary pop with darkly witty yet awkwardly verbose lyrics.</p>
<h2><em>Rockabye Baby!—Lullaby Renditions of Beastie Boys/&#8203;the Flaming Lips/&#8203;Lady Gaga/&#8203;Pixies/&#8203;Prince</em> (2008–2018)</h2>
<p>Basically rearranged MIDI files. Some work, some don't. What a racket this is.</p>
