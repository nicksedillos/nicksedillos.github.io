<p>What have I been up to? Well, after putting my website live I tested it on a shitty old Kindle Fire and discovered that a bunch of the special characters I was using were missing from my chosen font, and that they were only present in some proprietary OS fallback fonts which happened to be present on my other devices. In other words, they were unreliable. Of course, removing these three or four fancy symbols was not an option, because I'm <em>into typography</em>. After a bunch of obsessive research about Unicode and symbol fonts, I decided to instead set up a custom SVG icon set that would replace these missing characters as well as the ones I was sourcing from Font Awesome, so as to reduce my dependence on external CDNs.</p>
<p>This lead to another round of obsessive research about scalable vector graphics (SVG), and the methods by which a set of custom icons can be made with them. I've been wanting to make as much use of vector graphics as possible, so that fit my goals. Wanting to do things as elegantly as I can with my limited skills, I learned about SVG symbols as well as some of the weird CSS quirks of the format, and now I finally have a set of SVG icons that I can call upon inline without any external dependencies or large webfont files.</p>
<p>Next I discovered (after a few hours of frustration) that the easy peasy instant test server VS Code extension I was using had bugs that made my Frankenstein jQuery render incorrectly. So now I'm reteaching myself how to work with Node, and tomorrow I'll start learning how to use Express to set up a test server that doesn't inject a bunch of weird code that fucks up my stuff. After that I'll get to work removing all the jQuery and attempt to rewrite everything with modern vanilla JavaScript. Then I'll try (again) to fix the bad flickering of unstyled content that appears on loading. The more I learn, the more chores I find for myself.</p>
